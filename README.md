# SimpleGraphs
Java Desktop App - for graphing linear, quadratic, cubic, and logarithmic functions

A program that allows the user to input a function, and returns a graph of the function in a .txt file.

June 2020

Visible domain and range: D = [-20, 20] R = [-20, 20]

Function type options: linear, cubic, quadratic, logarithmic.

After selecting one or multiple graph types, the coefficients needed are input by the user,
and then a graph is generated from the function, and saved in a text file.

File names are in format sg-type-coefficients.txt, so graphs will be overwritten if they exist already.

ex: y = 2x + 1 --> sg-linear-21.txt
